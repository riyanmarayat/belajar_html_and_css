            <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
            <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-<wbr>sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-<wbr>low-<wbr>temperature poaching</q>.</p>
            <p>Next month, we will be serving <i>Sous Vide Salmon</i> with <i>Dill Hollandaise</i>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contack us before <date datetime="2016-11-30">November 30</date>.</p>

            <p><em><b>Warning:</b> <i>Sous vide</i> cooked salmon is not pasteurized. <strong>Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</strong></em></p>
